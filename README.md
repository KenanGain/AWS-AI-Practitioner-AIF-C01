## 📖 Study Tips & Tricks

1. **Master Core AI/ML Concepts**  
   - Understand key terms: _AI_, _ML_, _deep learning_, _neural networks_, _LLMs_, _inference vs. training_.  
   - Differentiate between _supervised_, _unsupervised_, and _reinforcement learning_.  

2. **Dive into Generative AI**  
   - Learn how foundation models are trained and fine-tuned (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models).  
   - Explore AWS services like **Amazon Bedrock**, **SageMaker JumpStart**, and **AWS DeepComposer**.  

3. **Explore Foundation Model Applications**  
   - Practice with real-world use cases: text generation, summarization, image generation, chatbots, and recommendation systems.  
   - Hands-on: deploy a simple generative AI endpoint using SageMaker.  

4. **Understand Responsible AI Principles**  
   - Study ethics, bias mitigation, interpretability, and fairness in AI workflows.  
   - Review AWS tools like **SageMaker Clarify** for bias detection and **Explainability**.  

5. **Learn Security, Compliance & Governance**  
   - Grasp data encryption (at rest/in transit), IAM roles/policies for ML pipelines, and data privacy controls.  
   - Know how AWS services (e.g., **AWS KMS**, **Amazon Macie**) support secure AI solutions.  

6. **Hands-On Labs**  
   - Use AWS Free Tier to spin up SageMaker notebooks, train a small model, and run inference.  
   - Experiment with Amazon Rekognition, Comprehend, and Transcribe to process images/text for AI insights.
